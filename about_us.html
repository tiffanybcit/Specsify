  <div class="info">
    <p>
      We’re a group of three students who study Computer Systems Technology at BCIT.
      Our team consists of one main coder, one main project manager and a main designer.
      When we first started on this project, we were all complete strangers to each other,
      it was the first day of class and we got paired randomly with two other people.
      Over a period of four months, our team became very close and worked diligently towards our end goal.

      </br>
      </br>

      We have created this application called “Specsify” for our “Projects 1” course.
      Our team wanted to create something that would take a certain input from the user and provide them with a solution
      of some sort.
      After days of research and discussion, we decided upon this idea of taking input from the user and us suggesting
      some laptops with that input - which was later refined to provide just the specs of those laptops.
      Our project has evolved and been redesigned constantly to provide the best possible user experience that we are
      able to.
      Over the span of our project, our team completed various sprints and improved tremendously with the help of our
      instructor.
      Every week, she provided us with new resources that allowed us to bring our project up a notch.
